f:T778,A boy. A wolf. The legend lives on. 

Dazzling entertainment, seamless story-telling, book seven in the bestselling Wolf Brother series is set in a world of myth, menace, natural magic and exhilarating adventure.

 A boy. A wolf. The legend lives on.

For two summers Torak and Renn have been living in the Forest with their faithful pack-brother, Wolf. But their happiness is shattered when Renn realizes Torak is in danger - and she's the threat.

When she mysteriously disappears, Torak and Wolf brave the Far North to find her. At the mercy of the Sea Mother and haunted by ravenous ice bears, their quest leads them to the Edge of the World. There they must face an enemy more evil than any they've encountered.

Viper's Daughter plunges you back into the Stone-Age world of Torak, Renn and Wolf: a world of demons, Hidden People and exhilarating adventure which has entranced millions of readers.

Viper's Daughter is the seventh book in the award-winning series that began with Wolf Brother, selling over 3 million copies in 36 territories. Like them it can be read as a standalone story.

PRAISE FOR VIPER'S DAUGHTER

'What rich, dazzling, immersive storytelling... The best book I have read this year by a country mile. (By a wild arctic length of many wolf lopes, I suppose I should say).' - Hilary McKay, author of The Skylarks' War

'Michelle is in a league of her own with this series and what luck for us all that she hasn't finished with Torak, Renn and Wolf's world yet.' - Abi Elphinstone, author of Rumblestar

'Viper's Daughter is sharp, striking, and loaded with the wisdom of the deep past. I am in awe of Paver's accomplishment.' - Sophie Anderson, author of The House with Chicken Legs

'Skillful, satisfying, and minutely researched, this powerful evocation of an ancient world is vivid in its imagery and captivating in its excitement.' - Adrienne Byrne, Muswell Hill Children's
